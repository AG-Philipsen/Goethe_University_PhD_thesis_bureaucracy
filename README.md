PhD thesis bureaucracy
======================

This repository is meant as guide to deal with the bureaucracy
needed to hand in the Ph.D. thesis at the Promotionbüro in Frankfurt
and later to organise the defense.
At the moment, it is valid only for the Physics faculty (Fachbereich 13)
of J. W. Goethe Universität.

Cloning the repository and reading the Procedure.pdf file (obtained
via `pdflatex Procedure.tex`), the role of each file should be clear.

Note for future maintainance
----------------------------

In order to keep this guide updated in future, it is crucial that upcoming
Ph.D. students maintain it, especially if some information stops to be
correct. Therefore, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests
whenever there are updates.
